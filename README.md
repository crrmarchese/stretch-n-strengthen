## User Story
```
AS a USER I want to have a centralized ‘application’ where I can see my SAVED workouts, and CREATE routines to fill my week.
A USER can go to our web page, and search for exercises/stretches based on body part.
A USER can login or create an account to SAVE exercises / workouts
If a USER is logged in they can then CREATE routines
USER can UPDATE their routines by DELETING workouts, or SAVING new exercises to their account
```
